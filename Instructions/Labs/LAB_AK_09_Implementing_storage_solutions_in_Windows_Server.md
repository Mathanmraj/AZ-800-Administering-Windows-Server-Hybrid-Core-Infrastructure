# Lab answer key: Implementing storage solutions in Windows Server

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-800%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Implementing%20storage%20solutions%20in%20Windows%20Server)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

> **Note**: Be sure to revert the virtual machines (VMs) between each exercise. Due to most of the VMs being Windows Server 2019 Server Core, the time it takes to revert and restart is faster than attempting to undo changes made to the storage environment in the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Implementing Data Deduplication
