# Lab answer key: Using Windows Admin Center in hybrid scenarios

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-800%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Using%20Windows%20Admin%20Center%20in%20hybrid%20scenarios)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server

#### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Connect to **SEA-ADM1**, and if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, start Microsoft Edge, go to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and sign in by using the credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you'll be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell pane by selecting the toolbar icon directly next to the search text box.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

   >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting Cloud Shell and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload**, and then upload the **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\L04-sub_template.json** file to the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands to create a resource group that will contain the resources you provision in this lab. (Replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of an Azure region into which you can deploy Azure virtual machines, such as **eastus**.)

   >**Note**: This lab has been tested and verified using East US, so you should use that region. In general, to identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [Find Azure credit offers in your region](https://aka.ms/regions-offers).

   ```powershell
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   $rgName = 'AZ800-L0401-RG'
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name az800l04subDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/L04-sub_template.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName $rgName
   ```

#### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload an Azure Resource Manager template **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\L04-rg_template.json** and the corresponding Azure Resource Manager parameter file **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\L04-rg_template.parameters.json**.
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to deploy an Azure VM running Windows Server that you'll be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -Name az800l04rgDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/L04-rg_template.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/L04-rg_template.parameters.json
   ```

   >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next exercise. The deployment should take about 5 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane.
1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box in the toolbar, search for and select the **az800l04-vnet** virtual network.
1. On the **az800l04-vnet** page, select **Subnets**, and then, on the **Subnets** page, select **+ Gateway subnet**.
1. On the **Add subnet** page, set the **Subnet address range** to **10.4.3.224/27**, and then select **Save** to create the **GatewaySubnet**.

## Exercise 2: Implementing hybrid connectivity by using the Azure Network Adapter

#### Task 1: Register Windows Admin Center with Azure

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
